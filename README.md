# Web-Scrapping-ZipRecruiter
As part of a bigger project, a team was tasked with web scrapping 
job posting websites such as ZipRecruiter, Indeed and LinkedIn to find the
most commonly sought after skills in the field of data science according to job postings. 
I was tasked with scrapping ZipRecruiter as seen in code provided.

If it interests you, a reccomender was created that uses ideal job as input 
and provides user with a list of online courses to take that match up the 
skills in the job posting. A repository on my profile named EducationAnalytics 
has all of this included.
