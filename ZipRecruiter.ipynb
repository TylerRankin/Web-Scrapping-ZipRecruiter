Investigated the use of Selenium which can act as a human and click buttons on the page, but browser drivers were needed so considered this not an acceptable option for this project. In the end I decided to make a loop scrolling through 5 pages of each city (20 results per page) to gain the data as typically only 5 pages were available per city."

      " job descriptionabout triplebytetriplebyte helps companies find and hire great technical talent. for any company building software this is crucial for success. a recent survey of top c-level executives across multiple industries showed that software r&d and recruiting technical talent are the top areas they are planning increased investment and budget over the next 5 years. companies like apple dropbox and american express trust triplebyte’s online technical assessment to identify the best engineers for their open roles and reduce the time and effort it takes to hire them.we just raised a $35 million series b and our team of 40 will double in size during 2019. now is a great time to join as we're on an exciting growth trajectory. you will have lots of opportunity for taking on responsibility and developing new skills quickly.we have built machine learning models that predict the likelihood of an engineer getting an offer from a particular company. interviewing and assessing engineering talent tends to be noisy but our technical assessment has proven to be good enough to extract meaningful signals. we collect data on interview results and in-house evaluations which gives us a unique dataset to play with. we've used that data to deliver a 40% conversion rate on our candidates at interview to offer compared to the industry standard 20%.our mission is to create a scientific method for identifying great talent and intelligently route it to the best place streamlining and speeding up the recruitment process while removing human biases that can hold back some candidates.we're an experienced team the founders have each built and sold companies before. ammon and guillaume founded socialcam acquired by autodesk for $60 million and harj was the first partner hired at y combinator since its founding.building the best productwe are rapidly growing our engineering team we are looking for generalist full-stack frontend backend machine learning and dev-ops engineers! the triplebyte engineering team is still rather small only 8 people. we all went through the triplebyte process : we move fast release new features daily and iterate quickly. triplebyte is growing very quickly and the engineering team is fully dedicated to supporting that growth in any way we can.we are a generalist engineering team we work on anything that helps the company or other teams grow. we cycle through backend full-stack and frontend work based on the most critical needs. all of us are encouraged to work on all those parts.our frontend is mostly in react redux.our backend is in ruby on rails postgres and redis. we also use python with tensorflow for all our data science work it doesn't seem like it but we have built a lot of software. we are a truly full-stack company and we are building a process that needs to be perfect ends to ends. we have software for engineers for interviewers for writers for companies for us etc..if that's any indication of scale we crossed recently the 200 tables in our postgres database : join us and help us build the best product! we value initiative productivity and ownership.compensation and benefitscompetitive salary and stock options packageopen vacation policyemployer paid health vision and dental insurance401 k plan with matchingpre-tax commuter benefitsdaily catered lunchesour missionwe believe strongly in building a truly meritocratic unbiased process for finding great talent. even the best technology companies today still use where people went to college as a proxy for intelligence and ability. we're building a process that looks only at ability not credentials so we can have a future where everyone can focus on just learning and being good at what they do not how they look on paper.every aspect of running a company has been improved over the last decade except hiring. most decisions are still made using amorphous terms like \"gut feel\" or \"culture fit\". they should be made using crisp data. only a company specializing on this problem using data collected from the hiring process at hundreds of companies can solve it. that's the company we're building. our mission is creating a scientific method for identifying great talent and intelligently routing it to the best place. starting with software engineers.work location:fully remotebenefits:health insurancedental insurancevision insuranceretirement planpaid time offflexible scheduleparental leaverelocation assistanceprofessional development assistancecompany descriptionhiring is hard. it’s something our founders understand well. before starting triplebyte harj was the first partner at y combinator where young companies often struggle to hire their first employees. guillaume and ammon were working on socialcam later acquired by autodesk in 2012 for $60m where they also experienced firsthand the challenges of hiring.triplebyte was founded on the belief that the current technical hiring process doesn’t do enough to help engineers show their strengths. our founders started triplebyte to help engineers find great jobs by assessing their abilities without relying on the prestige of their resume credentials.\n",
